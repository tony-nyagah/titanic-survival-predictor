## Titanic Survival Predictor
The Titanic Survival Predictor is a machine learning project that aims to predict the chances of survival for passengers aboard the Titanic. By analyzing historical data and building a predictive model, this project provides insights into the factors that influenced survival during the tragic event.

### Features
* Data analysis and visualization of the Titanic dataset
* Preprocessing and feature engineering techniques
* Machine learning model training and evaluation
* Web-based frontend for user interaction and survival prediction

### Dataset
The project utilizes the well-known Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including their demographics, ticket details, and survival outcomes. The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) and has been widely used for educational and research purposes.

### Technologies Used
* Python
* Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis
* Scikit-learn for machine learning model training and evaluation
* Flask (or Django) for web framework and frontend development
* HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend design and interactivity
* Heroku (or other hosting platforms) for deployment
